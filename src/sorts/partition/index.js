/* 
  Params: nums, left, right
    - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be
        the last idx.
    - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to
        partition.

  Steps:

  1. Pick an number out of the arr to be your pivot value
    - usually the middle idx but can be any.

  2. Partition the array IN PLACE such that all values less than the pivot
      value are to the left of it and all values greater than the pivot value
      are to the right (not perfectly sorted).

  3. return: the index where the left section of smaller items ends.

  "Choosing a random pivot minimizes the chance that you will encounter
  worst-case O(n^2) performance (always choosing first or last would cause
  worst-case performance for nearly-sorted or nearly-reverse-sorted data).
  Choosing the middle element would also be acceptable in the majority of
  cases."
