There is a one-dimensional garden of length N that is non-empty. In each
position of the N length garden, a fountain has been installed. Given an
array a[] such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain.
A fountain can cover the range from the position
max(i â€“ a[i], 0) to min(i + a[i], N - 1). In beginning, all the fountains
are switched off. The task is to find the minimum number of fountains needed to
be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.
