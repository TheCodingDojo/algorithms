## STUDENT WARNING

- **PLEASE SERIOUSLY CONSIDER** that looking up answers before you've thoroughly practiced trying to come up with a solution is setting yourself up for failure in interviews. Please spend the full algo group session trying to solve it amongst yourselves first--only looking up simple things like syntax.

## Internal

- Add daily solutions to a separate lecture repo so students aren't looking up the answers here ahead of time. This repo is public for it to be available to alumni.

## Clone Instructions & Source Control

- `git clone https://github.com/TheCodingDojo/algorithms.git`
  - `cd algorithms`
  - `npm i` to install dependencies.
- `git pull` whenever you want to check for new changes.
- To avoid merge conflicts if you want to take your own notes or add your own solutions, create a new file for whatever algo you are working on.
