/**
 * Concatenates the given arrays together into order that they are passed in.
 * - Time: O(n + m) -> O(n) linear. n = arr1.length, m = arr2.length. They are
 *    added instead of multiplied because the loops are not nested. This is
 *    simplified to O(n) because O(n + m) is still linear growth. The time it
 *    takes grows directly in proportion to the lengths. Whatever happens
 *    inside of a loop is multiplied by the amount of iterations.
 *    E.g., .push here, but .push does not loop, internally, so the size of
 *    the arrays have no impact on .push, so the .push is considered
 *    "constant" and constant's are ignored in Big O Notation.
 * - Space: O(n + m) -> O(n) linear. This algo takes up more space directly in
 *    proportion to the lengths of the inputs since the two arrays are being
 *    combined.
 * @param {Array<any>} arr1
 * @param {Array<any>} arr2
 * @return {Array<any>} The new arr that is a concatenation of the given arrays.
