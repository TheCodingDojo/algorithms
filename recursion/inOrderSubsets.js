/* 
  String: In-Order Subsets

  Create strSubsets(str) . Return an array with every possible in-order character subset of str. The resultant array itself need not be in any specific order â€“ it is the subset of letters in each string that must be in the same order as they were in the original string. 
  
  Input: "abc" , 
  Output: return an array that includes ["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"] (in any order).
