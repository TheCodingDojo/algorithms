# Pair Programming

- Talking about your experience with pair programming on your resume and in interviews can help you become a more desireable candidate to employers.

## Roles

### Driver

- This personâ€™s job is to share their screen and code while everyone is actively working through the problem. They should practice accurately following the navigator's directions.
- The driver should initially be the individual with the least coding experience from the group to to maximize learning. Roles should be cycled after a while though.

#### Drivers Learn

- Drivers learn to follow directions accurately, which requires learning and understanding the technical terminology being used. Drivers also learn to ask clarifying questions when needed, in addition to practice writing code and naming variables.
- Employers highly desire new hires that are good at following directions to make sure pair programming sessions on the job are productive.

### Navigators

- These team member(s) should be helping the driver navigate through the problem to reach the desired destination (a solution). This entails giving the driver guidance on what to type. Depending on the driver's experience level, they may need very detailed directions.
- Navigators should start their guidance with pseudocode before actual code.

#### Navigators Learn

- Navigating is difficult and requires you to learn how to provide clear directions (pseudocode and actual code) so the directions can be followed precisely.
- In order for directions to result in reaching the desired destination (a solution), the navigators learn to develop a map of the terrain (the problem to be solved) so they can plan the steps to reach the destination.
- Navigators also learn how to navigate back to the correct path when a wrong turn has been taken.
- Employers prize good navigators because they make great team members by facilitating productive collaboration sessions and can effectively guide new hires.

### Presenter

- Responsible for sharing their code and presenting the solution and transferring knowledge to the whole group if their team is called on to present. Presenters should also practice diagramming while presenting, such as using zoom annotations to draw visuals.

#### Presenter's Learn

- Presenters learn valuable public speaking skills and practice clearly articulating and diagramming code on varying levels, such as a high level and/or more detailed.
- Employers want good presenters because you will likely be required to present in daily meetings in front of your peers and boss about what you are working on and what obstacles you are facing.
- Sometimes teams work through problems verbally, and with a whiteboard--if you have an idea to help solve the problem in this situation, you'll need to be able to present it clearly to year teammates.
